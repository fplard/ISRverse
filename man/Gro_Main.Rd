\item{coresubse}{\code{data.frame} including at least the following columns \emph{binSpecies}, \emph{SexType}, \emph{AnimalAnonID}, \emph{BirthType} and \emph{Birthdate} (\code{date})}

\item{Taxa}{\code{character} the name of the taxa studied}

\item{Species}{\code{character} the name of the species studied}

\item{BirthType}{\code{vector of character} "Captive", "Wild", and/or "All"}

\item{AgeMat}{\code{numeric} age at sexual maturity.}

\item{type}{\code{character} Either 'weight' or 'length'.ht}

\item{MeasureType}{\code{vector of characters} Name of the type of measurements that should be included.  Default: all measurement types are included.}

\item{MinInstitution}{\code{numeric} Minimum number of institutions that should hold records to run the analysis.}

\item{UncertDate}{\code{numeric}: Maximum uncertainty accepted for measurement dates, in days}

\item{MinNGro}{\code{numeric} Minimum number of weight needed to fit the growth models}

\item{MinNIGro}{\code{numeric} Minimum number of unique individuals needed to fit the growth models}

\item{models}{\code{vector of characters} indicating the growth models that need to be fit.The following models are supported : logistic, gompertz, chapmanRichards, vonBertalanffy, polynomial.}

\item{percentiles}{\code{vector of numeric} indicating the percentiles that need to be estimated. default = c(2.5,97.5) corresponding to the 95\% predicted interval.}

\item{PlotDir}{\code{character} Directory to save the plots. Default: no plot is saved.}

}
\value{
A list including an analysis by sex and by birth type as included in the input. Each analysis includes:
\itemize{
\item The fit of the growth models with the AIC table of the model, the fit of the best model, a data frame with the percentile selected and 3 GOF test including the normality of residuals and the test of trend in residuals against X and in the variance of the residuals.
\item A summary with the number of individuals and weight used for the analysis:
}
\itemize{
\item NInd_raw  and, NWeight_raw indicate the number of unique individuals and the number of weights once the sex, the birth type, the measurment type from global collection have been selected
\item NWeight_val and NInd_val indicate the number of unique individuals and the number of weights once valid  measurment from Husbandry have been selected
\item NJuv= 0 and NAd indicate the number of weights of juveniles and adults selected
\item NJuv_keep= 0 and NAd_keep indicate the number of weights of juveniles and adults selected after removing
outliers
\item NWeight and NInd indicate the total number of unique individuals and the number of weights used for the analysis
\item a logical indicated if the growth analysis was performed
\item If the growth analysis was not performed, an error and its number (Nerr) are returned: The possibility for  this functions are: 1/No raw data and 2/No valid weight measure 3/Data from 1 Institution 4/ NWeight < MinNGro #' 5/NInd < MinNIGro 6/Best model did not fit.
If PlotDir is filled, 2 plots are produced: one showing the outliers removed from the data, and one showing the fit of the model on the data.
}
}
\description{
Select measures, remove outliers, select the best growth model and produce the percentile of the best fitting growth model for the sexes and birth types selected.
