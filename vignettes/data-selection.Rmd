# Create the species profile report

`tx_report()` runs the survival, reproduction and growth analyses for the selected species. It uses the following main arguments:

* `taxa` the name of the taxa studied
* `species` the name of the species studied
* Data for each analysis: at least `core` and `collection`, in addition to `weights`, `parents`, `contraceptions` if needed.   
* `PlotDir`: Directory to save the plots of the best models
* `repout` Previous result of the taxon profile for this species if it needs to be updated
* `sexCats` Sex categories: Male, Female or All 
* `minN` Minimum number of individuals needed to run the analyses
* `minDate` Earlier date to include data records
* `models_sur`  names of the survival basta models to run: "G0", "EX", "LO" and/or "WE"
* `shape` shape of the survival basta model to run: "simple", "Makeham", "bathtub"
* `models_gro` indicating the growth models that need to be fit.The following models are supported : logistic, gompertz, chapmanRichards, vonBertalanffy, polynomial. default = "vonBertalanffy"



```{r examples-tx_report}
data(core)
data(collection)
PlotDir = paste0(tempdir(check = TRUE),'\\temp')
dir.create(PlotDir)

out <- tx_report(species = "Gorilla gorilla", taxa = "Mammalia",
                 core, collection, 
                 PlotDir = PlotDir,Sections = c('sur'),
                 sexCats = c("Male", "Female"),
                 models_sur = "GO", shape = "simple",
                 models_gro = "vonBertalanffy",
                 niter = 1000, burnin = 101, thinning = 10, nchain = 3, ncpus = 3
)

list.files(PlotDir)
unlink(PlotDir, recursive = TRUE)

```

# Extract Data

This function extracts the data of the specified species that fill the condition on minimum date and global collections. It includes the following argument:

* `species` latin name of the species selected
* `coresubset`data.frame including at least the following columns *anonID*, *BirthDate*, *DepartDate* (\code{date}), *EntryDate* (\code{date}), *MaxBirthDate* (\code{date}), *MinBirthDate*, *EntryType*, *DepartType*, *DepartFrom*, *firstInst*, *LastTXDate*, *DeathDate*, *lastInst*,*globStat*, *LastCollectionScopeType*, and *FirstCollectionScopeType*
* `collection` data.frame including at least the following columns*RecordingInstitution*, *ChangeDate*, *ScopeType*, and *AnimalID*.
* `minDate`: Earlier date to include data
* `extractDate`: Date of data extraction
* `Global` Whether only individuals belonging to global collections should be used.


The output is a list including:
* The subseted dataset
* a summary of the data used:
- Nraw : Raw number of individuals selected from global collections
- Ndate : Number of individuals with an entry date posterior to the minimum date
- Nglobal: Number of individuals selected from global collections
- Nalive: Number of individuals still alive
- firstDate: Date of first record
- maxAgraw: Maximum observed age




```{r examples-select_species}
data(core)
data(collection)
out<- select_species(species = "Gorilla gorilla gorilla", coresubset = core, collection,
                     minDate = "1980-01-01", extractDate = "2023-01-01")
out$summary
out$data
```

# Gap analysis in longevity

`select_Longthreshold()` runs a gap analysis on the distribution of longevity and gives the threshold value to use in this distribution to avoid having gaps in longevity. It plots the distribution of longevities with gaps. It can focus on a given sex using the following arguments:

*  `data.core`including at least the following columns *Birth.Date*, *Depart.Date*, *Entry.Date*, and *Sex*
* `sexCats` Male, Female or All
* `PlotDir` Directory to save the plots
* `maintitle` name of the graph to be saved
* ` minN` Minimum number of individuals

It returns the data with the selected sex and additional columns showing which individuals are above the percentiles 95%, 99% and 99.9%
and a summary list including the threshold value selected for the distribution of longevity.


```{r examples-select_Longthreshold}
TempDir <- paste0(tempdir(check = TRUE),'\\temp')
dir.create(TempDir)
data(core) #### CHANGE DATASET WITH ONE EXCLUDING ABOVE95 99 99.9
out <- select_Longthreshold (data.core = core,  sexCats = "All", 
                             PlotDir = TempDir, maintitle = 'Gorilla_gorilla')
list.files(TempDir)
#remove temporary folder
unlink(TempDir, recursive = TRUE)
```

## Find gaps in a continuous variable

`find_gaps` Looks for gaps within a continuous variable. Number are rounded and gaps are found if one number is not represented. Gaps are returned only if the length of the gaps is 20% higher than the starting age of this gap. It uses the following arguments:

* `x` variable to analyze
* `maxAlive` Return gaps higher than this maximum, only. Default = NA
* other arguments pass to `hist()`

It returns a data frame where each line is a gap described by its initial/starting age, its final/ending age and its length


```{r examples-find_gaps}
x = runif(10,0,40)
out<-find_gaps(x,maxAlive = 5, plot = FALSE)
```
